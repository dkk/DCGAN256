# DCGAN256

A DCGAN used to train a hand generator that outputs 256 x 256 RGB images using the 11K hands Dataset.

For more details, see the [jupyter notebook](Hand%20Generator.ipynb).

# Environment

The jupyter notebook was implemented to run in Google Colab, but it would be easy to change it to use a local or remote instance instead.

# Result

The following GIF shows the output of the model in about the first 1000 epochs:
